# Restaurant-Website

This project aims to create an online platform for a
restaurant to showcase its menu, provide information
about its services, and enable customers to order food
online. This website will present the restaurant's menu
with clear categorization, detailed descriptions, and with
images of dishes. The technologies used in this website
are JSP, JDBC, Servlets and MySQL. JSP is used to build
the user interface, handle user requests, and interact with
the server-side logic. In this project, MySQL is used to
create the database schema and tables for storing
information related to users information and orders. It
allows efficient querying and retrieval of data required by
the website. Servlets are used in conjunction with JSP to
implement the server-side logic of the website. JDBC is
used to establish a connection to the MySQL database,
execute SQL queries, and retrieve or update data
